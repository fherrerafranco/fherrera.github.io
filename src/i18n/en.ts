      content: 'I am a software backend developer with experience utilizing the Node.js runtime environment and writing code in Javascript/TypeScript. Over the last years, I have designed, developed and maintained multiple services using frameworks and tools like Express, NestJS, Node-RED, DevOps tools like Docker and Kubernetes, working extensively with RESTful APIs and persisting data in MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases. I have built custom npm libraries, event-driven microservices, implemented end-to-end and unit tests with Jest, Mocha and other testing frameworks to ensure code reliability and safety.\nI have worked with cloud platforms like AWS (EC2 deployments and monitoring of dockerized services, S3 storage units, Lambda functions, CloudWatch monitoring), Azure (AKS, Blob Storage, AKS Cluster Registries), and Google Cloud (GKE, Log Analytics), ArgoCD cluster management and much more.\nWith this knowledge acquired through the years I have collaborated with companies from industries like telecom, logistics, and retail to improve their workflows by automating different parts of it. I enjoy solving problems, working closely with interdisciplinary, multi-cultural teams and communicating complex ideas in a clear way. I am always in continuous learning to enhance my skills and contribute to successful projects.'
